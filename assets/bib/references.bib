  abstract = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) addresses the complexity of modern-day embedded system design. Multiple MDE frameworks are often integrated into a design process to use each MDE framework's state-of-the-art tools for increased productivity. However, this integration requires substantial development effort. In this paper, we propose an MDE framework based on a formalism of system graphs and trait hierarchies for programming-language-agnostic integration between tools within our framework and with tools of other MDE frameworks. Implementing our framework for each programming language is a one-time development effort. We evaluate our proposal in an MDE design process by developing a Java supporting library and an AMALTHEA connector. Then we perform an MDE industrial avionics case study with both. The evaluation shows that our framework facilitates the integration of different tools and the independent development of different system parts. Therefore, our framework is a reliable MDE framework that lowers the effort of integrating tools to benefit from their combined state-of-the-art.},

  abstract	= {System level optimization for multiple mixed-criticality applications on shared networked multiprocessor platforms is extremely challenging. Substantial complexity arises from the interdependence between the multiple subproblems of mapping, scheduling and platform configuration under the consideration of several, potentially orthogonal, performance metrics and constraints. Instead of using heuristic algorithms and problem decomposition, novel unified design space exploration (DSE) approaches based on Constraint Programming (CP) have in the recent years shown promising results. The work in this paper takes advantage of the modularity of CP models, in order to support heterogeneous multiprocessor Network-on-Chip (NoC) with Temporally Disjoint Networks (TDNs) aware message injection. The DSE supports a range of design criteria, in particular the optimization and satisfaction of power and throughput. In addition, the DSE now provides a valid configuration for the TDNs that guarantees the performance required to fulfil the design goals. The experiments show the capability of the approach to find low-power and high-throughput designs, and validate a resulting design on a physical TDN-based NoC implementation. },

A key concept of ForSyDe is the use of higher-order functions as process constructors to create processes. This leads to well-defined and well-structured ForSyDe models and gives a solid base for formal analysis. The book chapter introduces the basic concepts of the ForSyDe modeling framework and presents libraries for several MoCs and MoC interfaces for the modeling of heterogeneous systems, including support for the modeling of run-time reconfigurable processes.",

 abstract = {New design methodologies and modeling frameworks are required to provide a solution for integrating legacy code and {IP} models in order to be accepted in the industry. To tackle this problem, we introduce the concept of wrappers in the context of a formal heterogeneous embedded system modeling framework. The formalism is based on the language-independent concept of models of computation. Wrappers enable the framework to co-simulate/co-execute with external models which might be legacy code, an {IP} block, or an implementation of a partially refined system. They are defined formally in order to keep the analyzability of the original framework and also enable automations such as generation of model wrappers and co-simulation interfaces. As a proof of concept, three wrappers for models in different abstraction levels are introduced and implemented for two case studies.},
